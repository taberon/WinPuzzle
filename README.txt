Simple sliding tile puzzle game (like fifteen puzzle) using a bitmap -- built with C#, Windows Forms, and GDI+.

Here are some keys/things to try:
R - Reset Puzzle
N - Toggle Numbers
3 - Make Puzzle Easier..?
5 - Make Puzzle Harder..?

Also, an image named "image.bmp" will be used if found in the runtime directory rather than the default.
